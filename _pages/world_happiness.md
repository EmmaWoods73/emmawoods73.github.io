This project applies a variety of supervised and unsupervised data mining methods to data obtained from the 2019 World Happiness Report. Steps taken to clean, prepare and explore this large structured dataset in order to perform further analysis are described. A variety of machine learning techniques are then executed against select variables in order to uncover patterns and predict happiness levels within regions and countries across the globe. Models employed include Association Rules Mining, K-means Clustering, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and additional Text Mining methods.
