The aim of this project was the design and implementation of a database in order to solve a business data management problem. Following identification of stakeholders and the data they need to access and maintain, a SQL database is constructed in order to answer five specific data questions.

The project document outlines all design specifications detailing the data to be tracked and how the elements work together. Also specified are business rules that dictate how the data is to be managed.

Implementation of the database design is also described, including SQl statements used to create the tables and columns to constrain the data, and the database rules utilized.
